# Libcows.js

Shows awesome cows in terminal.

## Example

```
const libcows = require('libcows')

console.log(libcows()) // prints all, 426 cows in a array

console.log(libcows.randomCow()) // prints a randomly selected cow

console.log(libcows.printRainbowedRandomCow()) // prints a rainbow colored random cow

```

## Visual example

```
         (__)  s
         (@@) s

## Notes

I can't stand npm packages which forces you to have a lot of meta files and shit for maybe a single javascript file with 3 lines. So I've added dependencies so libcows remains with no dependencies :)
